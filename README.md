# PSET 1: Intro & Java Constructs

## Part 1: Interpreting Code
In this section, you will read and interpret Java code and answer questions 
about common mistakes in Java syntax. Complete the questions in Part1.txt and 
Mistakes.java. By the end of this task, Mistakes.java should compile and run 
smoothly.

Goals:
 * Understand common errors in Java syntax and interpret error messages 
 accordingly.
 * Comprehend Java code and understand how to trace through code segments 
 in Java.
 * Understand Javadoc and how it should be formatted for this course.

## Part 2: Writing Code
In this section, you will write your own methods and basic Java program to 
perform a simple task. This requires effective command of Java constructs, 
including some APIs we introduced in class. You will continue to build your 
skills with arrays, loops, conditionals, and more Java constructs throughout 
the semester. Complete the file RPS.java.

Goals:
 * Understand how to compile and run a simple Java program to interact with 
 user input.
 * Gain experience with BlueJ, output, and interacting with Java programs.
 * Write effective Javadoc to ensure outside users can easily comprehend 
 the purpose of code.
 
## Part 3: Introduction to Adventure Games
Throughout the PSETs and assignments in this course, you will slowly develop 
your own text-based adventure game. You are welcome to choose whatever theme 
you'd like, and you can add additional functionality unique to your theme as 
the course goes along. This project will be broken down for you into 
manageable parts, and we're excited to see your creativity and play your games 
at the end of the semester. This is meant to provide you with hands-on project experience, which you may include on your resume or GitHub profile in the future. 
For this PSET, we'd like you to start brainstorming a theme by playing the 
text-based games we've provided and reflecting on what aspects you might include 
in your game. Additionally, you will get a first look at what adventure game 
source code might look like.

## Part 4: Charting Your Adventure Game
In this task, we'd like you to draw a map of your adventure game. According to 
whatever theme you've chosen, chart a map (on paper!) of your game's world. 
Include the following elements:
 * At least 4 rooms, with one room that is initially locked.
 * At least one treasure chest per room, with the key to the locked room inside one
   of them, as well as at least two treasures (some food, some other treasures) 
   per chest.
 * At least 3 animals, in various rooms, with various values for the damage 
   they can do.
 * Designate one room as the starting location, and number your rooms starting from 
   zero.
Feel free to be as artistic (or not) as you'd like, and you can include any extra 
elements that you'd like.
When you're finished, take a picture of your map and upload a .png or .jpeg file to 
this repository.

## Part 5: First Adventure Game File
To begin your adventure game project, create a new BlueJ project (Open BlueJ >
Project > New Project) in a directory of your choice. Then, copy the provided 
file Game.java and follow the instructions. When you're done working in your 
project folder, copy and paste the code you've written back into this repository.
