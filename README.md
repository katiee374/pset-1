# PSET 1

## Part 1: Interpreting Code
In this section, you will read and interpret Java code and answer questions 
about common mistakes in Java syntax. Complete the questions in Part1.txt and 
Mistakes.java. By the end of this task, Mistakes.java should compile and run 
smoothly.

Goals:
 * Understand common errors in Java syntax and interpret error messages 
 accordingly.
 * Comprehend Java code and understand how to trace through code segments 
 in Java.
 * Understand Javadoc and how it should be formatted for this course.

## Part 2: Writing Code
In this section, you will write your own methods and basic Java program to 
perform a simple task. This requires effective command of Java constructs, 
including some APIs we introduced in class. You will continue to build your 
skills with arrays, loops, conditionals, and more Java constructs throughout 
the semester. Complete the file RPS.java.

Goals:
 * Understand how to compile and run a simple Java program to interact with 
 user input.
 * Gain experience with BlueJ, output, and interacting with Java programs.
 * Write effective Javadoc to ensure outside users can easily comprehend 
 the purpose of code.
 
## Part 3: Introduction to Adventure Games
Throughout the PSETs and assignments in this course, you will slowly develop 
your own adventure game. It will start as an old-fashioned text-based adventure 
game, but later in the course you can add a GUI component for a visually 
appealing game experience. You are welcome to choose whatever theme you'd like, 
and you can add additional functionality unique to your theme as the course 
goes along. This project will be broken down for you into manageable parts, 
and we're excited to see your creativity and play your games at the end of 
the semester. This is meant to provide you with a real project experience, 
which you may include on your resume or GitHub profile in the future. For 
this PSET, we'd like you to start brainstorming by playing the text-based 
games we've provided, interpreting the code segments, and reflecting on 
what aspects you might include in your game.

## Part 4: First Adventure Game File
To begin your adventure game project, create a new BlueJ project (Open BlueJ >
Project > New Project) in a directory of your choice. Then, copy the provided 
file Game.java and follow the instructions.
